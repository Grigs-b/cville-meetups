# Real-time Data-heavy web apps
## PyCho March 12, 2015
### Presenter: Gilman Callsen / @gcallsen

Notes!~
### PyCon
Andrew proposed a post PyCon PyCHO debrief to present information that was given out at PyCon

Overview
* Server side events
* Redis pub/sub
* Real time analytics in python
* Angular web app

### System Overview

Nascar
Notified of lap times and placement change events in the race

Core part of race is what to do in Pit

What size is his team? How much time is able to be dedicated to this app?

Inputting the tendencies of all drivers into the application. "What are the competitors likely to do?"

Stack:
REST API
Python / Flask
Postgres / Redis / RabbitMQ

Using Docker containers for all instances.

>Have team of people live entering pit data during race

Production / Staging / Experimental servers in AWs

### Redis Pub/Sub and SSE
**Server Sent Events**
* JS API `EventSource`
* One way, server to client
* Part of HTML5 spec
* Nice Stack Overflow explanation
* Similar to long polling, but no re-establishing connection

```
var source = new EventSource('/stream');
source.onmessage = function(event) {
  //do something
}
```

**Redis Pub/Sub**
* Easy in flask app
* Multiple channels on same server supporting multiple apps
  * PRRA, PDE, PDA (?)
* Flask example of pub/sub taken from StackOverflow
* Some extra Ngnix configuration required to avoid timeout and cache buffer problems

**Real Time Analytics in Python**
* fun/challenging
* startup: wanted to get into market quickly, which is why python was chosen
* Having to go back and refactor for optimization now
* AWS / 4 core machines
  * Fast lap time tracks / high number of laps makes these machines struggle (15 second lap times on some tracks)
(Q: How many times during a race does a decision have to happen. A: ~10, but variable)

**Libraries:**
* Numpy
* Pandas
* scikit-learn

Historical frequencies / tendency based data. Integrated in real time during the race

Non-live test case, see if it has influence, if so merge into production
Just did a study on caution frequency both historical and realtime car clumpiness /etc

Have back to 90s of historical data

(Q: Do you ensure to other teams you wont be sharing data? A: No one sees the value in making it proprietary. Nascar is more difficult to model than, say, F1, due to full field cautions / more unknowns. Caution basically starts the race over. Nascar also does not make data available like F1 does)
(Q: Can you predict cautions? A: Working on that. )

**Some Stats**
* Input: >18,000 data points processed / race
* Output: 2mil-6mil datapoints output as raw / predictive
* Throughput: ~600,000 api transactions per instance per race (>55 / second)
* Data: 150-200MB computed data stored / race. Compressed to ~50mb sent
(Q: how important is historical vs. real time once the race starts? A: weighted average, historical counts more at start and tapers off throughout the race)

### Data Heavy Web App in Angular
**Angular and Data Binding**
* Started with Backbone, looked at Ember, liked 2 way data binding from Angular
* Data to template quickly
* Analytics workspace, requires 2 way binding
* Workspace means custom/ reusable elements -> __Directives__
  * if it looks like a graph, its all the same directive, just different data
* ng-repeat directive has been only performance problem
  * regular grid of numbers was biggest problem, not graphs
* using coffeescript
  * Biggest gotcha -> implicit return on all methods, so watch out
* Really nice message handlers, get the source code for this

### Take aways
* Chrome's EventSource API is buggy -> double check SSE connection status
* You will miss events
  * Must have strategies to retrieve missed packets
  * Client keeps track of events, requests from redis cache on missed event
* Live analytics are hard
* Lean on Redis to take pressure off Postgres
* Async is necessary but dangerous
  * watch race conditions. 10 workers processing multiple queues
* "Refresh the browser" not a valid excuse

Using Celery for brokering messages between workers

Questions:

1. Manual input of pit data. How difficult is that and what is the app that handles that like?

  a. Pits are hectic. Lot of pain for training documents. 5 people dedicated to watching feed. Nascar provides to the public (but not the team) GPS data/pit data. Can't take programmatically, but can have 5 person team watch then manually enter. If there's a conflict, have pit user resolve
2. How have you sped up analysis to keep track

  a. Wrote things very quickly at the start, go back and optimize "get it working" code. Cache where possible, all the time, always. Coding originally, was fastest to ask db. Now need to be more careful.
3. Any tools out there that would have made things easier / not having to write your own sw?

  a. Pretty proprietary, nothing much out there. Have looked into static video analysis of track, Nascar makes this difficult. Internet at track is terrible.
4. Thought about or used this for any application outside of Nascar?

  a. One in particular, media rights. Mostly analytics side, not real time. Also, fantasy Nascar / prediction. Not paid, just find it fun. Esports fantasy
5. What's your team like? Size/Makeup/Background?

  a. 2 statisticians. Do the heavy lifting. They write code that another colleague makes "work". 3 full time. Hiring. Especially for backend/sysops. PitRho. Totally distributed currently. Contract work until they get more money. Part time/ nights and weekends as contract for now, ramp up appropriately later once money available. Core tenants: Fun, Cool, With good people. Strong python/sysops/devops

6. Numpy/Pandas/Scikit realtime or offline?
  a. Numpy/Pandas realtime, Scikit offline
Trying to reduce Postgres transactions
Have 16 core machines as stopgap

RabbitMQ for messaging between workers
  Gotcha: default saves phantom information in queue. results_backend. Turn off. Eats all memory. Part of Rabbit's guaranteed delivery. 

Numba: Optimize calculations. Drop in replacement for Numpy that makes it faster. Adds typing/other things automatically

Center for Open Science: Everything open source. Web application. Hiring fronted/backend devs and data scientists.
